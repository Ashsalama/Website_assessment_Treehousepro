        <h1>The process</h1>
        <p class="process_paragraph">We will start by determining which trees are suitable for holding a treehouse, and then<br> look at some sample plans to get an idea of what is possible and indicative costs. Next<br> we will work out the size, layout and style of the treehouse and come up with some <br>draft plans. After deciding on the plan to proceed with, we contract an engineer to go<br> through the design and ensure that it will be safe and stable, now and as the tree<br> grows. Once the plans are finalised, I will organise any necessary building consent and<br> construction can begin.</p>
        <p class="process_paragraph"><br><br>The building process starts with the platform, and after this has been constructed rigorous<br>testing will take place to ensure that it meets the highest standards. Next we will add the<br> wall framing andÂ  install the roof before building the floors, walls, entrances, windows and <br>railings. If your treehouse has a particular theme, this is where we will add the little touches<br> that bring that to life, such as doorknobs, lighting and decorative elements. Lastly comes<br> the really fun part as we add those special extras such as slides, bridges, fire poles, zip lines<br> and climbing nets to make your treehouse really stand out!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
